# YouPHPTube-Encoder-Network (YEN)
Agregator for YouPHPTube Encoder Servers

YouPHPTube-Encoder-Network (YEN) is a platform designed to streamline your video encoding.

This platform has been implemented so that several encoders can be monitored in real time.

The system works by doing some real-time testing on the encoders servers, with check ping speed, queue encoding length and free memory of each server. 

With this information the (YEN) helps you decide which encoder to use.

The use is the same as using a simple encoder, but this tool will help you choose the best encoder at the time of encoding.

After choosing the encoder you wish to use use the instructions contained here https://github.com/DanielnetoDotCom/YouPHPTube-Encoder/wiki/How-to-submit-videos-to-the-encoder

We have it installed here with 2 encoders https://network.youphptube.com/
